# 📚 DevChronicle
Track your code journey with smart AI-powered commit messages.

DevChronicle helps you auto-commit your code on file save, idle, and track your progress with intelligent commit messages generated by AI.

## 🎯 Features
* 🤖 **AI-Powered Commit Messages** - Uses Groq AI to generate meaningful commit messages
* 💾 Auto-commit on file save
* 🔄 Auto-commit on file switch
* ⚙️ Configurable file types (.js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx, .css, .scss, .html)
* ⏸️ Pause & resume auto-commits
* 📊 Shows commit stats (files & commits per session)
* ⚠️ Conflict detection before committing
* 🔒 Secure API key storage (encrypted by VS Code)

## 🚀 Installation
1. Open VSCode
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for `DevChronicle` and install it
4. **Set up AI (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
   - Run `DevChronicle: Set Groq API Key`
   - Get a **FREE** API key at [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)
   - Paste your key (it's encrypted and stored securely)

## 🤖 AI Commit Messages

### Why Use AI?
Instead of generic messages like "update code", get meaningful ones like:
- `feat(auth): add JWT token validation`
- `fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue`
- `refactor(api): optimize database queries`

### Getting Your Free API Key
1. Go to [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. Click "New token"
3. Name it something like "DevChronicle"
4. Copy the token (starts with `gk_`)
5. Run `DevChronicle: Set Groq API Key` in VS Code
6. Paste your token - it's stored securely! 🔒

### Is It Really Free?
✅ **YES!** Hugging Face offers generous free tier:
- 1000+ requests per day
- No credit card required
- Community models are free forever

### What If I Don't Want AI?
No problem! Just disable it:
- Go to Settings → Extensions → DevChronicle
- Uncheck "Use AI Commit Messages"
- Falls back to smart pattern-based messages

## 📖 Usage
* Auto-commit triggers:
   * On file save (and switch to another file)
   * Configurable idle time (2–5 min)
* Commands:
   * `DevChronicle: Set Groq API Key` - Configure AI
   * `DevChronicle: Commit Now` - Manual commit
   * `DevChronicle: Pause Auto-Commit` - Pause for 1 hour
